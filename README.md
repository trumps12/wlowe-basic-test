## Images 

All of the images for a post are in the post's resource bundle. 
The markdown image tag renderer, and the gallery renderer each take a string .e.g `image.jpg`. 
**This is not a full URL**. 
If there is `image.jpg` in the post's resource bundle, it will find it and resize it and create proper URLs.

## Floating images

Add an image to the markdown with e.g.

`![.fl|Crepe](crepe.jpg)`

The `.fl` is a class that will float the image left. This is a customisation, and is not part of markdown standard.
