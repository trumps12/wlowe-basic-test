I am a photographer living in wonderful New Zealand.  I have a passion for sharing the wonders of the natural world one image at a time.
Please have a look at my portfolios. I currently focus on having the birds images printed onto alluminium panels using dye sublimation which makes them ideal as garden art.
If you are interested in any of the images please make contact.

Having recently purchased a campervan I am now travelling and re-discovering how wonderful New Zealand is.
I will also post the occasional blog of our local travells when these travels result in memorable images.
